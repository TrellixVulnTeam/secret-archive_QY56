# Secret Archive [WIP]
## What?
It's a program that compresses and encrypts files and stores them in a vault-like archive.

## Installation
### Requirements
Python 3 and some other modules. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### How can I start encrypting my "homework"?
Just run `python3 ./main.py` (Use python3) after installing requirements.


## Why?
Compression and Encryption is fun.

## How did you make this?
My per day thinking process is documented in the [Jupyter Notebook](./archive.ipynb).

## The Code is bad
I'm trying my best. If you really hate it that bad, just create an Issue or Pull Request.

## You're collecting my data!
No. The code is open source. It doesn't even access the internet. I don't want to see your weird compressed files anyway.

## Thanks
Thanks to [PseudoCodeNerd](https://github.com/PseudoCodeNerd/) for initial testing and bearing with my shitty code.
